# ARKat

A simple AR Pet using Apple AR Kit plugin on Unity

## Getting started

If you want to use the AR Kit plugin on your project you must follow this step-by-step guide

### Prerequisites

- iOS Device with a A8 chip or best
- Macinstosh device with Xcode 9 installed
- Unity

### Installing

**Follow the next steps:**

1. Open Unity on your device and download the [AR Kit Plugin](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/92515)
2. Once donwloaded, import the files off the plugin
3. You are ready to go!

## Getting deeper

I have the plugin installed but, now what?

### The assets

When you have all the files imported, you must think, how do I do something with this? Well, we are on our way

First of all navigate through the folders and find the one called `/Examples/UnityARKitScene` double click on the asset **UnityARKitScene**.
You must see something like this:

### Understanding the game objects

The image on top ilustrates the current scene. Currently this game will just place one cube wherever you touch the screen. But wouldn't it be cooler that you could change that "ugly" cube and place instead one 3D object? In this example you will use the [Cartoon Cat](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/70180) asset that you can found on the Asset Store.


You just have to replace the `HitCube` gameobject for one of the 3D models that you can find in the Cartoon Cat asset.

After adding the 3D model, the scene must be something like this:



Then you just have to build the game with:  ⇧ + ⌘ + B
